In a collaborative team setting, I spearheaded the development of an Advanced Weather Assistant for a Hackathon event (Dexterix 3.0). This project involved integrating a voice assistant, sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi, and an interactive monitoring website. Coordinating and facilitating the implementation of the project was a key role I played. Leveraging my expertise in Python programming with Flask and frameworks, I optimized the functionality of the system. My proficiency in IoT, Raspberry Pi, and sensor integration was instrumental in achieving this. Effective communication with team members was a priority throughout the project. I streamlined processes, resolved technical challenges, and ensured the project's success. Collaborating with the team, providing mentorship, and executing planned tasks were also part of my responsibilities.
